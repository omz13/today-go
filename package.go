// Package today is used to answer the eternal question: is today the day (for an
// event that happens on a certain date each year).
//
// For a limited set of named events, helpers are available, i.a. BeCssNakedDay
// per [https://css-naked-day.github.io/]; BeJsNakedDay per
// [https://js-naked-day.org/]; BeTowelDay per
// [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day].
//
// Otherwise, IsInternationalDay indicates if a requested month and day is
// occurring now anywhere on Earth, or its sibling IsDayMonth for occurrence in
// the current timezone.
