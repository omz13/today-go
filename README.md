# today
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/omz13.com/go/today-go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/omz13.com/go/today-go)

```shell
go get omz13.com/go/today-go
```


Package today is used to answer the eternal question: is today the day (for an event that happens on a certain date each year).

To install:

	go get omz13.com/go/today-go

For a limited set of named events, helpers are available, i.a. BeCssNakedDay per \[[https://css-naked-day.github.io/](https://css-naked-day.github.io/)]; BeJsNakedDay per \[[https://js-naked-day.org/](https://js-naked-day.org/)]; BeTowelDay per \[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel\_Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day)].

Otherwise, IsInternationalDay indicates if a requested month and day is occurring now anywhere on Earth, or its sibling IsDayMonth for occurrence in the current timezone.
